# spammailclassification
To run the Spam Email Classification code, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset files:
   - Create two text files: `spam_emails.txt` and `ham_emails.txt`.
   - Populate `spam_emails.txt` with a collection of labeled spam emails. Each email should be on a separate line.
   - Populate `ham_emails.txt` with a collection of labeled non-spam (ham) emails. Each email should be on a separate line.
   - Save the dataset files in a directory of your choice.

2. Update the file paths:
   - Open the SpamEmailClassification.java file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
   - Locate the lines that specify the file paths in the `main()` method.
   - Update the file paths to match the directory and file names of your dataset files and the email you want to classify.

3. Compile the code:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the SpamEmailClassification.java file.
   - Compile the code by running the following command: `javac SpamEmailClassification.java`
   - This command will compile the Java source code and generate a compiled bytecode file named SpamEmailClassification.class.

4. Run the code:
   - After successful compilation, run the code by executing the following command: `java SpamEmailClassification`
   - The program will read the training data, train the classifier, and classify the specified email.
   - The classification result (spam or ham) will be displayed in the console.

Note: Make sure you have Java installed on your computer and the `java` command is accessible from the command line. Also, ensure that you have the correct file paths specified in the code for your dataset and email files.

Remember to adjust the code according to your specific dataset and requirements.

To run the Spam Email Classification code, you'll need the following files:

1. `SpamEmailClassification.java`: This is the Java source code file that contains the implementation of the Spam Email Classification project.

2. Training Data Files:
   - `spam_emails.txt`: A text file containing a collection of labeled spam emails. Each email should be on a separate line.
   - `ham_emails.txt`: A text file containing a collection of labeled non-spam (ham) emails. Each email should be on a separate line.

3. Email File:
   - `email.txt`: A text file containing the email that you want to classify. The content of the email should be in the same format as the emails in the training data files, with each word separated by a space.

Ensure that you have the `SpamEmailClassification.java` file and the necessary training data files (`spam_emails.txt` and `ham_emails.txt`) in the same directory. Additionally, have the email file (`email.txt`) ready to be used for classification.

Before running the code, make sure to update the file paths in the code to match the directory and file names of your dataset files and the email file you want to classify.

Once you have all the required files in place, you can follow the instructions provided earlier to compile and run the Spam Email Classification code.
